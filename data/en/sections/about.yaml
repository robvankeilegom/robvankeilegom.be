# a summary about you
summary: "I'm a 26 year old developer graduated in June 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Networks, Systems and Security. I currently work as a Progress developer at Organi (Wilrijk, Belgium). In my free time I work on personal or open source projects. When I'm not programming I'm probably busy volunteering at Frag-o-Matic, playing video- and boardgames or out snowboarding.
<br /><br />
Programming is my passion as you can see by the many projects I've worked on: lots of projects in different languages. I love experimenting which is why some projects are unfinished. As I see it, it's not about the destination but about the experience gained.
