# a summary about you
summary: "I'm 26 year old. I graduated in June 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Networks, Systems and Security. Currently I work as a Full Stack developer at Organi (Wilrijk, Belgium).
<br /><br />
In my spare time I like to work on personal projects. My personal projects don’t always include coding. As you would’ve
guessed from my education I’m also really into electronics. So when I’m not holding a keyboard, I’m probably holding a
soldering iron. For the more social activities I enjoy playing video- and board games with my friends, snowboarding and
wall climbing/bouldering.
<br /><br />
Programming is my passion as you can see by the many projects I've worked on: lots of projects in different languages. I love experimenting which is why some projects are unfinished. As I see it, it's not about the destination but about the experience gained.
