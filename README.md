# Uni-t Boilerplate

### Getting Started

- Terminal
    - Run `composer install`
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `gulp` or `gulp watch`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` & change settings

- You can rename the App and its namespaces by using `php artisan app:name`

### Multi language

- For multi-language projects the validation, pagination and password translations will automatically be set. You should only need to create your own custom translations.

- There is a standard english translation file for the Auth views (login/register/password reset...)

- To publish other standard translation files run `php artisan trans:publish <locale>`

### This boilerplate includes

- Bootstrap
- FontAwesome
- jQuery
- Humans.txt
- Favicon, touch icons and tiles

Installing other packages should be done through `npm`
